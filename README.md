This API is purely to test out the experience of writing in the Go language and gain better understanding of 'concurrency'.  
It uses a Mongo DB hosted on mLab.  If you plan on forking create a free mLab account and replace the connection string with yours in the 
*repository* file.  I was originally following this [blog post](https://medium.com/@gautamprajapati/writing-a-simple-e-commerce-website-api-in-go-programming-language-9f671324b4dd).

**Requirements**
-Golang installed
-mLab Account 

**Initializing**
Run *go run main.go* and navigate to *http://localhost:8000/*
You may need to adjust your Go path to allow access to which repository you host this project
